# The Quot scheme (A.2.b)

This file is the **A.2.b** file-skeleton sub-build chapter for the project's
positive-genus arm of `nonempty_jacobianWitness`. It packages the
Grothendieck–Altman–Kleiman Quot-scheme construction
`Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` — a projective `S`-scheme representing the functor of
`T`-flat coherent quotients of `E_T` on `X_T = X ×_S T` with Hilbert
polynomial `Φ` on every fiber — together with the in-project sub-build for
the Grassmannian *scheme* (Mathlib at the pinned commit carries only a
linear-algebra Grassmannian).

## Status (iter-176 Lane H file-skeleton — re-dispatch)

iter-175 Lane H died to the Anthropic session-limit reset window without
ever calling `Write` (the file was never created). iter-176 re-dispatches
the file-skeleton verbatim. Each of the six blueprint-pinned declarations
carries the *intended* substantive type signature (matching the
`\lean{...}` pin in `blueprint/src/chapters/Picard_QuotScheme.tex`) with a
`sorry` body. The bodies are iter-177+ work; the substantive proofs are
deep (Nitsure §5: boundedness ⟶ Grassmannian embedding ⟶ flattening
stratification ⟶ valuative criterion).

The 6 blueprint-pinned declarations are:

1. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.hilbertPolynomial` (def, ~5 LOC) — the
   **Hilbert polynomial function** `s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ]` of a coherent
   sheaf `F` on `X` over a finite-type `π : X ⟶ S` with respect to a
   line bundle `L`. Encoded as a function `S → Polynomial ℚ`.

2. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.QuotFunctor` (def, ~6 LOC) — the **Quot
   functor** `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S} : (Sch/S)^op ⥤ Set` sending an
   `S`-scheme `T ⟶ S` to the set of equivalence classes
   `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` with `F` a `T`-flat coherent sheaf on
   `X_T`, `q : E_T ↠ F` a surjection, and `F|_{X_t}` having Hilbert
   polynomial `Φ` at every `t ∈ T`.

3. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Grassmannian` (def, ~5 LOC) — the
   **Grassmannian functor** `Grass(V, d) : (Sch/S)^op ⥤ Set` of
   rank-`d` quotients of a locally free `O_S`-module `V`.

4. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Grassmannian.representable` (theorem, ~8 LOC)
   — the **representability of the Grassmannian** by a smooth projective
   `S`-scheme `Gr_S(V, d)` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`, equipped with
   the Plücker closed embedding into `ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

5. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.QuotScheme` (theorem, ~10 LOC) — the
   **Grothendieck–Altman–Kleiman representability theorem** for the Quot
   functor: for a noetherian `S`, a projective `π : X ⟶ S`, a relatively
   very ample `L` on `X`, a coherent `E`, and `Φ ∈ ℚ[λ]`, the functor
   `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` is representable by a projective `S`-scheme.

6. `AlgebraicGeometry.flatBaseChangeCohomology` (theorem, ~10 LOC) — the
   **flat base-change theorem of cohomology** (Stacks tag 02KH): for a
   cartesian square with `g` flat and `f` quasi-compact quasi-separated,
   the canonical base-change map `g* (f_* F) ⟶ f'_* ((g')* F)` is an
   isomorphism. The current scaffold encodes the `i = 0` direct-image
   form (substantive content of (ii) of the Stacks 02KH statement); the
   `R^i f_*` form for `i ≥ 1` requires the higher-direct-image
   infrastructure not present at the pinned commit.

## Note on type expressivity

Following the project rule "Never weaken the type to dodge the proof",
each declaration carries a substantive, non-tautological type:

- `hilbertPolynomial` returns `Polynomial ℚ` keyed by `s : S`, not
  `Unit`; the Hilbert polynomial is a non-trivial invariant of the
  coherent sheaf at the fiber over `s`.
- `QuotFunctor` and `Grassmannian` return contravariant functors into
  `Type u` — substantive presheaves of sets, not constant functors.
- `Grassmannian.representable` and `QuotScheme` package the
  `Functor.RepresentableBy` Yoneda-bijection structure: existence of a
  scheme `Y` together with a `RepresentableBy Y` witness — substantive
  content (a representable functor is determined by its representing
  object up to canonical isomorphism, and the witness is the data of
  that isomorphism family).
- `flatBaseChangeCohomology` produces a `Nonempty (... ≅ ...)` of an
  isomorphism between two `S'`-modules built via the pullback/pushforward
  bifunctor; the iso is non-trivial (it is `Stacks 02KH` content, not
  the identity-on-the-same-object iso `Iso.refl _`).

## Mathlib status

Mathlib (master `b80f227`) provides:
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules` (the category `X.Modules`),
- `Scheme.Modules.pullback`, `Scheme.Modules.pushforward` (the
  pullback–pushforward adjunction at level `i = 0`),
- `CategoryTheory.IsPullback` for cartesian squares,
- `CategoryTheory.Functor.RepresentableBy` for representable functors,
- `AlgebraicGeometry.Flat`, `AlgebraicGeometry.QuasiCompact`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.QuasiSeparated`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsProper`,
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyOfFiniteType`, `AlgebraicGeometry.IsLocallyNoetherian`
  (morphism / object property predicates), and
- `Polynomial` for `ℚ[λ]`.

Mathlib does NOT provide (at the pinned commit):
- a Grassmannian *scheme* (only a linear-algebra Grassmannian
  as a finite-rank-quotient variety),
- a `IsProjective` morphism property,
- the Quot/Hilbert functor or its representability,
- `R^i f_*` higher direct images on `Scheme.Modules`,
- Castelnuovo–Mumford `m`-regularity,
- Snapper's Lemma for the polynomial property of Euler characteristics.

The current file-skeleton uses `IsProper π` as the structural stand-in
for "projective `π`" (every projective morphism is proper; the
restriction is harmless in the Route A consumer setting where `π` comes
from a smooth proper curve, which is automatically projective).
iter-177+ refinement: once Mathlib gains an `IsProjective` morphism
property, the hypothesis tightens.

/-! ## §1. Hilbert polynomial of a coherent sheaf

For a finite-type morphism `π : X ⟶ S` with `S` noetherian and a coherent
sheaf `F` on `X` whose schematic support is proper over `S` (here encoded
as plain `X.Modules` for the file-skeleton), the per-fiber Hilbert
polynomial is the function

`s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ],   Φ_{F,s}(m) = χ(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗m})`.

Snapper's Lemma ensures this is a polynomial in `m`; the proof requires
graded-Euler-characteristic infrastructure and is not stated here.

Blueprint reference: `def:hilbert_polynomial` (Nitsure §1; cf. Hartshorne
III.5.2). -/

/-- The **Hilbert polynomial** of a coherent sheaf `F` on `X` over `S` at
the fiber over `s ∈ S` with respect to a line bundle `L` on `X`.

Encoded as a function `s ↦ Φ_{F,s} ∈ ℚ[λ]`. The defining formula

`Φ_{F,s}(m) = χ(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗ m})
            = Σ_i (-1)^i dim_{κ(s)} H^i(X_s, F|_{X_s} ⊗ L_s^{⊗m})`

is a polynomial in `m` by Snapper's Lemma; the polynomial coefficients
depend on `s` through the fiber `F|_{X_s}`. When `F` is `S`-flat the
function `s ↦ Φ_{F,s}` is locally constant on `S`.

iter-177+: the body unfolds to the graded-Euler-characteristic
construction once `χ` of a coherent sheaf on a noetherian scheme +
Snapper's polynomial-eventually-property are in scope. For the iter-176

/-! ## §2. The Quot functor

The Quot functor `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` sends an `S`-scheme `T ⟶ S` to the
set of equivalence classes `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` where
- `F` is a coherent sheaf on `X_T = X ×_S T` whose schematic support is
  proper over `T` and which is `T`-flat,
- `q : E_T ↠ F` is a surjective `O_{X_T}`-linear homomorphism,
- the fiberwise Hilbert polynomial of `F|_{X_t}` with respect to `L|_{X_t}`
  equals `Φ` at every `t ∈ T`.

Two pairs `(F, q)` and `(F', q')` are equivalent iff `ker(q) = ker(q')`.

The Hilbert scheme is the special case `E = O_X`:
`Hilb^{Φ,L}_{X/S} = Quot^{Φ,L}_{O_X/X/S}`.

/-- The **Quot functor** `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` of coherent quotients of `E`
on `X ×_S -` with Hilbert polynomial `Φ`.

Encoded as a contravariant functor `(Over S)ᵒᵖ ⥤ Type u`, sending an
`S`-scheme `T → S` (i.e. an object of `Over S`) to the set of
equivalence classes `⟨F, q⟩` of pairs `(F, q)` of a `T`-flat coherent
sheaf `F` on `X ×_S T` with proper support and a surjection
`q : E_T ↠ F` whose fiberwise Hilbert polynomial is `Φ`, modulo
`ker(q) = ker(q')`. Functoriality is pullback of the quotient along
`X ×_S T' ⟶ X ×_S T`.

iter-177+: the body packages the on-objects / on-morphisms data using the
`Scheme.Modules.pullback` bifunctor on the relative product
`X ×_S T`, with the equivalence relation `ker(q) = ker(q')` quotiented
out via `Setoid` / `Quotient`. For the iter-176 file-skeleton the body
is a typed `sorry`. -/

/-! ## §3. The Grassmannian scheme

Since Mathlib carries no Grassmannian *scheme*, we encode it here as a
contravariant functor on `Over S` together with a representability
statement. The construction proceeds by gluing `binom(r, d)` affine
charts `U^I ≅ A^{d(r-d)}_S` along the Plücker cocycle, yielding a smooth
projective `S`-scheme `Gr_S(V, d)` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`,
equipped with a tautological rank-`d` quotient
`π* V ↠ U` and the Plücker closed embedding into `ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

`Grass(V, d) = Quot^{d, O_S}_{V/S/S}` (the Quot functor for `X = S`,
`E = V`, constant Hilbert polynomial `d`).

/-- **Representability of the Grassmannian.**

For a noetherian scheme `S`, a locally free `O_S`-module `V` of rank `r`,
and `1 ≤ d ≤ r`, the Grassmannian functor `Grass(V, d)` of
`Grassmannian` is representable by a smooth projective `S`-scheme
`Gr_S(V, d) ⟶ S` of relative dimension `d(r-d)`, equipped with a
tautological rank-`d` quotient `π* V ↠ U`. The determinant line bundle
`det(U)` is relatively very ample, giving a Plücker closed embedding
`Gr_S(V, d) ↪ ℙ_S(⋀^d V)`.

We package the conclusion as the existence of a representing
`Y : Over S` together with a `Functor.RepresentableBy Y` witness for
`Grassmannian V d`; the additional projective / smooth / Plücker
structure is implicit in the construction and is iter-177+ refinement
work (once the proof body lands).

iter-177+: the body follows Nitsure §1 "Construction of Grassmannian":

Plücker cocycle, verify separatedness via the diagonal cut, verify
properness by the DVR valuative criterion, build the tautological

bundle. For the iter-176 file-skeleton the body is a typed `sorry`. -/

/-! ## §4. Representability of the Quot scheme

Grothendieck–Altman–Kleiman: for a noetherian `S`, a projective
`π : X ⟶ S`, a relatively very ample `L` on `X`, a coherent
`E` on `X`, and `Φ ∈ ℚ[λ]`, the Quot functor `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` is
representable by a *projective* `S`-scheme.

The proof has four steps (Nitsure §5):
1. **Boundedness** via Castelnuovo–Mumford `m`-regularity (uniform across
   fibers of `π` and across coherent quotients of `E_s` with Hilbert
   polynomial `Φ`).
2. **Grassmannian embedding**
   `α : Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S} ↪ Grass(W ⊗_{O_S} Sym^r V, Φ(r))`
   for `r ≥ m`, sending `⟨F, q⟩ ↦ ⟨(π_T)_* F(r), (π_T)_*(q(r))⟩`.
3. **Locally closed in Grassmannian** via the flattening stratification
   applied to the universal cokernel on the Grassmannian, producing the
   stratum `T_0^Φ`.
4. **Closed embedding** by the valuative criterion of properness for
   DVRs.

The reduction to the universal case `X = ℙ(V)`, `E = π*W` is recorded as
`lem:quot_reduction_to_pi_star_W` in the blueprint chapter.

Blueprint reference: `thm:quot_representable` (Nitsure §5; FGA Explained
Ch. 5; Grothendieck, FGA TDTE-IV). -/

/-- **Representability of the Quot scheme** (Grothendieck, Altman–Kleiman).

Let `S` be a noetherian scheme, `π : X ⟶ S` a projective morphism (here
encoded as a proper `LocallyOfFiniteType` morphism; the projectivity
upgrades once `IsProjective` lands in Mathlib), `L` a line bundle on `X`
(relatively very ample), `E` a coherent `O_X`-module, and
`Φ ∈ ℚ[λ]`. Then the Quot functor `Quot^{Φ,L}_{E/X/S}` of `QuotFunctor`
is representable by an `S`-scheme.

We package the conclusion as the existence of `Q : Over S` together with
a `Functor.RepresentableBy Q` witness for `QuotFunctor π L E Φ`; the
*projectivity* of `Q ⟶ S` (and the universal quotient
`q^univ : π^*_Q E ↠ F^univ` on `X ×_S Q^{Φ,L}`) is implicit in the
construction (Plücker-embedded into a projective Grassmannian over `S`)
and is iter-177+ refinement work.

iter-177+: the body follows the four-step Nitsure §5 proof
(boundedness ⟶ Grassmannian embedding ⟶ flattening stratification ⟶
valuative-criterion closed embedding); the sub-lemmas live in
`lem:quot_boundedness`, `lem:quot_alpha_injective`,
`lem:quot_valuative_criterion`, and the existential reduction in
`lem:quot_reduction_to_pi_star_W`. For the iter-176 file-skeleton the
body is a typed `sorry`. -/

/-! ## §5. Cohomology and base change

The Quot construction uses cohomology-and-base-change in two places: the
boundedness step (Nitsure §5 "Use of m-Regularity") and the Grassmannian
embedding (Nitsure §5 "Embedding Quot into Grassmannian"). We record the
relevant statement as a named theorem so the Lean encoding can cite it
directly.

The Stacks 02KH form is the statement for higher direct images
`R^i f_*` on quasi-coherent sheaves; for the iter-176 file-skeleton we
state the `i = 0` form on `Scheme.Modules`, which is the substantive
content of `lemma-flat-base-change-cohomology(ii)` of Stacks 02KH. The
`R^i` form is iter-177+ work after higher-direct-image infrastructure
is in scope.

Blueprint reference: `thm:flat_base_change_cohomology` (Stacks 02KH). -/

/-! ### Flat base change of cohomology (Stacks tag 02KH, `i = 0` form)

Let
```
   g'
X' ───→ X

f'      f
↓       ↓
S' ───→ S
   g
```
be a cartesian square of schemes with `g` flat and `f` quasi-compact
quasi-separated. Let `F` be a sheaf of `O_X`-modules. Then the canonical
base-change map `g* (f_* F) ⟶ f'_* ((g')* F)` is an isomorphism in
`S'.Modules`.

(The full Stacks 02KH statement covers all higher direct images
`R^i f_* F` for `i ≥ 0`; the `i = 0` form encoded here is the
substantive content of `lemma-flat-base-change-cohomology(ii)` of
Stacks 02KH, with the `i ≥ 1` form post-iter-177 work after the
higher-direct-image bifunctor lands.)

iter-177 (Lane QS-FLAT): the body constructs the canonical base-change
natural transformation via the mate equivalence of the
`pullback ⊣ pushforward` adjunction (Mathlib's `mateEquiv` of
`Scheme.Modules.pullbackPushforwardAdjunction`), then exhibits the iso
via the `canonicalBaseChangeMap_isIso` helper. The deep mathematical
content (Stacks tag 02KH / 02KE / 00H8) lives entirely in the helper;
it reduces affine-locally to: for a flat ring map `A → B` and an
`A`-algebra `R`, the canonical map `B ⊗_A H^i(X, F) → H^i(X_B, F_B)`
is an iso for any quasi-coherent `F` (the `i = 0` form is what we use).
The helper remains a typed `sorry` pending the affine-local reduction
+ algebraic flat base change; this is iter-178+ body work after
quasi-compact open-cover Mayer-Vietoris infrastructure is in scope. -/

`g' ≫ f = f' ≫ g`.

This natural transformation always exists (no flatness needed). The

/-! ### Project-side typed-sorry: affine-open section formula for `Scheme.Modules.pullback`

The load-bearing Mathlib gap for `_of_isAffineBase` is the affine-open
section formula identifying

  `Γ((pullback g).obj N, U)  ≃  Γ(Y, U) ⊗_{Γ(X, V)} Γ(N, V)`

for any compatible affine pair `(V ⊆ X, U ⊆ Y)` of a morphism `g : Y ⟶ X`
of schemes and a sheaf of `O_X`-modules `N`. The pullback functor
`Scheme.Modules.pullback g` is built as `SheafOfModules.pullback` via the
partial-adjoint machinery and has NO closed-form `pullback_obj_obj` simp
lemma (cf. `analogies/quotscheme-pullback-affine-section.md` table for the
mathlib survey). We introduce the typed-sorry def below as the
project-side `BUILD_PROJECT_HELPER` declaration the analogy file recommends;
the body (~120–200 LOC) is iter-184+ work via the `Tilde` route on Spec
+ promotion to a general affine open in `Y`.

iter-183 Lane F PIVOT (helper budget #1): the def adds a single named
project-side sorry (Tier-3, direct sorry on a substantive type) that
captures the algebraic content the consumer
`_of_isAffineBase` is waiting on. -/

/-- **Project-side base linear map for `pullback_app_isoTensor`** (iter-185
Lane F substantive step).

Built from the unit of the `pullback ⊣ pushforward` adjunction at the
`V`-section level: the unit produces a morphism of `𝒪_X`-modules
`N ⟶ (pushforward g).obj ((pullback g).obj N)`, and evaluating its
underlying `PresheafOfModules`-val at `V` gives a `Γ(X, V)`-linear map
`Γ(N, V) →ₗ[Γ(X, V)] Γ((pushforward g).obj ((pullback g).obj N), V)`.
By `pushforward_obj_obj` (definitional), the codomain is the same data as
`Γ((pullback g).obj N, g ⁻¹ᵁ V)` with `Γ(X, V)` acting through restriction
of scalars along `g.app V`.

This `let`-only construction is axiom-clean (no `sorry`); it captures
exactly Step 1 of the Tilde-isoTop body plan documented in the consumer's
docstring. The substantive bijectivity claim (Stacks 02KE / 01HQ algebraic
flat-base-change content) is encapsulated separately in
`pullback_app_isoTensor_isBaseChange`, allowing the consumer iso to
discharge cleanly via `IsBaseChange.equiv.symm`. -/
private noncomputable def pullback_app_isoTensor_unitAtV

/-- **Step 2 of the Tilde-isoTop route** (iter-186 Lane F): the `Γ(X, V)`-linear
base map for the affine-open section formula.

Combining the axiom-clean unit `pullback_app_isoTensor_unitAtV` with the
presheaf-restriction `((pullback g).obj N).presheaf.map (homOfLE e).op` (from
the larger open `g ⁻¹ᵁ V` to the smaller open `U`) gives a `Γ(X, V)`-linear
map
`Γ(N, V) →ₗ[Γ(X, V)] Γ((pullback g).obj N, U)`,
where the `Γ(X, V)`-action on the target is via the algebra map
`(g.appLE V U e).hom : Γ(X, V) ⟶ Γ(Y, U)`.

The codomain of `unitAtV`,
`Γ((pushforward g).obj ((pullback g).obj N), V)`, is definitionally equal
to `Γ((pullback g).obj N, g ⁻¹ᵁ V)` by `pushforward_obj_obj` (rfl), which is
what makes the composition with the presheaf restriction typecheck.

`Γ(X, V)`-linearity uses the defining decomposition
`g.appLE V U e = g.app V ≫ Y.presheaf.map (homOfLE e).op`
(definitional from `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.appLE`): linearity in the

A sheaf of modules `M` on a scheme `X` is *locally free of rank `d`* when `X`
admits an open cover `{U i}` on each member of which the restriction
`M|_{U i}` (the pullback of `M` along the open immersion `(U i).ι`) is

`SheafOfModules.free (ULift (Fin d))` over the structure-ring sheaf of the

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — annihilator ideal sheaf and schematic support

These declarations build the annihilator ideal sheaf of a sheaf of modules and the
support/properness predicates of `blueprint/src/chapters/Picard_QuotScheme.tex`,
§"Support and freeness predicates". Mathlib (at the pinned commit) carries no
annihilator ideal sheaf for sheaves of modules on a scheme, nor a schematic-support
or proper-support predicate, so they are built here.

The annihilator is packaged via `Scheme.IdealSheafData.ofIdeals`, exactly mirroring
Mathlib's `Scheme.Hom.ker` (which is `ofIdeals fun U ↦ RingHom.ker (f.app U).hom`):
`ofIdeals` produces *the largest ideal sheaf contained in* an arbitrary affine-local
family of ideals, so the structure's `map_ideal_basicOpen` coherence is discharged
internally and need not be supplied at definition time. The basic-open coherence that
makes the local annihilators agree with `ofIdeals` (the analogue of `Hom.ker_apply`,
`def:modules_annihilator`) is the separate characterization lemma `annihilator_ideal`,
which depends on the not-yet-closed QCoh→localization bridge
`isLocalizedModule_basicOpen` (`lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`) together with
the algebra engine `Module.annihilator_isLocalizedModule_eq_map`
(`lem:annihilator_localization_eq_map`); see the handoff in

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — annihilator under localization

The annihilator ideal sheaf `def:modules_annihilator` of a coherent sheaf is
built from the affine-local data `U ↦ Ann_{O(U)}(F(U))`, packaged as a
`Scheme.IdealSheafData`. The structure's coherence field `map_ideal_basicOpen`
requires the algebraic fact that, for a *finitely generated* module, the
annihilator commutes with localization:
`Ann(S⁻¹M) = (Ann M)·S⁻¹R`. Mathlib (at the pinned commit) does not carry this
lemma, so it is supplied here as the load-bearing engine for that construction.
-/

namespace Module

/-- For a finitely generated module `M` over a commutative ring `R`, the
annihilator commutes with localization: if `Rₚ` localizes `R` at a submonoid
`S` and `f : M →ₗ[R] Mₚ` localizes `M` at `S`, then the annihilator of `Mₚ`
over `Rₚ` is the extension (`Ideal.map` along `algebraMap R Rₚ`) of the
annihilator of `M` over `R`.

This is the abstract `IsLocalization`/`IsLocalizedModule` form, matching the
shape needed for the affine-basic-open coherence of the annihilator ideal sheaf
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.annihilator`, `def:modules_annihilator`):
the structure-sheaf restriction `Γ(X,U) → Γ(X, D(f))` is
`IsLocalization (powers f)`, and for a quasi-coherent `F` the section
restriction is `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)`.

Mathlib has no annihilator-localization lemma, so this is project-local. -/

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — quasi-coherent sections localize on a basic open

This section builds, bottom-up, toward the keystone
`lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`: for a quasi-coherent sheaf of modules `M`
on a scheme `X`, an affine open `U`, and `f ∈ Γ(X,U)`, the restriction
`M(U) → M(D(f))` exhibits `M(D(f))` as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `Γ(X,U)`.

The substance is the affine (Spec-local) computation: over `Spec R`, a quasi-coherent
sheaf is `Ñ = tilde N` for `N = Γ(M)`, and the basic-open restriction of `Ñ` is the
module localization map. Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.tilde` namespace already carries
the localization fact for `tilde N` *as the map out of `N`* (the instance
`IsLocalizedModule (.powers f) (tilde.toOpen N (basicOpen f)).hom`). The first building
block below repackages this as a statement about the *presheaf restriction map* of `Ñ`
itself (from global sections to `D(f)`), which is the form the downstream scheme-level
argument consumes after the affine identification `M|_U ≅ Ñ`.

Mathlib (at the pinned commit) does **not** prove that an arbitrary quasi-coherent sheaf
on `Spec R` lies in the essential image of `tilde` (the comment in
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Tilde.lean` says this "will later be shown"); the
equivalence `QCoh(Spec R) ≃ Mod R` is a genuine gap. Consequently the keystone for an
*arbitrary* quasi-coherent `M` is gated on that bridge (`IsQuasicoherent M → IsIso
M.fromTildeΓ`); the building blocks here are stated for `tilde N` directly, and for a
general `M : (Spec R).Modules` under the explicit hypothesis `[IsIso M.fromTildeΓ]`
(equivalently, `M` in the essential image of `tilde`). -/

/-- **Basic-open restriction of a `tilde` sheaf is a module localization.**

For `N : ModuleCat R` and `f : R`, the presheaf restriction map of the associated sheaf
`Ñ = tilde N` from global sections `Γ(Ñ, ⊤)` to the basic open `Γ(Ñ, D(f))` exhibits the
latter as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R`.

This is the affine, Spec-local heart of `lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`. Mathlib
carries the localization fact for the map `tilde.toOpen N (D f) : N → Γ(Ñ, D(f))` out of
`N`; since `tilde.toOpen N ⊤ : N → Γ(Ñ, ⊤)` is an isomorphism and
`tilde.toOpen N (D f) = tilde.toOpen N ⊤ ≫ restriction` (`tilde.toOpen_res`), precomposing
the localization map with the inverse isomorphism (`IsLocalizedModule.of_linearEquiv_right`)
transfers the property to the restriction map. Project-local: Mathlib states the fact only

/-- **Basic-open restriction localizes, for a sheaf in the essential image of `tilde`.**

For a sheaf of modules `M` on `Spec R` whose tilde-Gamma counit `M.fromTildeΓ` is an
isomorphism (equivalently, `M` lies in the essential image of the `tilde` functor — the
honest Spec-affine stand-in for quasi-coherence, see the section header), the presheaf
restriction map of `M` from global sections `Γ(M, ⊤)` to the basic open `Γ(M, D(f))`
exhibits the latter as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R`.

This transports `isLocalizedModule_tilde_restrict` across the isomorphism
`M.fromTildeΓ : tilde N ⟶ M` (where `N = Γ(M, ⊤)`): the induced presheaf isomorphism is
natural in the open, so on each of `⊤` and `D(f)` it provides an `R`-linear isomorphism
intertwining the two restriction maps. Post- and pre-composing the localization map for
`tilde N` with these isomorphisms (`IsLocalizedModule.of_linearEquiv`,
`IsLocalizedModule.of_linearEquiv_right`) yields the property for `M`.

Project-local: it is the affine engine of `lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`. The
general quasi-coherent case additionally requires the (currently Mathlib-absent) bridge

/-- **`IsIso M.fromTildeΓ` from per-basic-open section localization** (the cheap stalk/section
assembly of `lem:qcoh_affine_isIso_fromTildeΓ`, the blueprint "G1-assemble" step). If for every
`f : R` the section restriction `Γ(M, ⊤) → Γ(M, D(f))` of a sheaf of modules `M` on `Spec R`
exhibits the target as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R` — exactly the conclusion of G1-core
(`lem:qcoh_affine_section_localization`,
`isLocalizedModule_basicOpen_of_isQuasicoherent`) — then the tilde-Gamma counit `M.fromTildeΓ` is
an isomorphism (equivalently `M` lies in the essential image of `tilde`).

On each basic open `D(f)` the component of `modulesSpecToSheaf.map M.fromTildeΓ` is a map between
two localizations of `N = Γ(M, ⊤)` at `powers f`: the source `Γ(tilde N, D(f))` localizes via the
instance `tilde.toOpen N (D f)` and the target `Γ(M, D(f))` localizes by hypothesis, and the two
localization maps are intertwined by `Scheme.Modules.toOpen_fromTildeΓ_app`. Hence the component is
the canonical localization isomorphism (`IsLocalizedModule.linearEquiv`);
`isIso_sheaf_of_isIso_app_basicOpen` upgrades this to an isomorphism of sheaves, and
`modulesSpecToSheaf` being fully faithful reflects it to `IsIso M.fromTildeΓ`.

This turns the remaining keystone obligation into exactly G1-core: combined with the converse engine
`isLocalizedModule_restrict_of_isIso_fromTildeΓ`, the per-basic-open localization hypothesis is
*equivalent* to `IsIso M.fromTildeΓ`. Project-local: Mathlib has no `IsQuasicoherent → IsIso

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — G1-core (Route F) building blocks

The keystone G1-core `lem:qcoh_affine_section_localization` asks: for a *quasi-coherent*
`M : (Spec R).Modules` and `f : R`, the section restriction `Γ(M,⊤) → Γ(M,D(f))` is
`IsLocalizedModule (powers f)`. Via `isIso_fromTildeΓ_iff_isLocalizedModule_restrict` this is
*equivalent* to `IsIso M.fromTildeΓ` — i.e. to the statement that a quasi-coherent sheaf on an
affine scheme lies in the essential image of `tilde` (the `QCoh(Spec R) ≃ Mod R` equivalence). That
equivalence is a genuine Mathlib gap at the pinned commit (Tilde.lean only proves the *globally
presented* case, `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation`).

The composition lemma below discharges the **globally-presented** sub-case end to end (it is the
Route-F endpoint once a global presentation/tilde identification is in hand). The residual gap is
exactly the production of a global presentation/tilde from local (quasi-coherent) data on `Spec R`;
see the handoff in `task_results/.../QuotScheme.md`. -/

/-- **Basic-open restriction localizes, for a globally presented module.** If `M : (Spec R).Modules`
admits a global `SheafOfModules.Presentation`, then for every `f : R` the section restriction
`Γ(M,⊤) → Γ(M,D(f))` exhibits the target as `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R`.

This is the composition of Mathlib's `isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation` (a global presentation
forces `M.fromTildeΓ` to be an isomorphism, i.e. `M` is a `tilde`) with the affine engine
`isLocalizedModule_restrict_of_isIso_fromTildeΓ`. It is the Route-F endpoint for the
globally-presented case; the general quasi-coherent case additionally requires producing a global
presentation/tilde identification from the (Mathlib-absent) affine `QCoh(Spec R) ≃ Mod R` bridge.

infinite — open cover `q.X : q.I → (Spec R).Opens` of `⊤` with a presentation of
`M.over (q.X i)` on each member), there is a *finite* family of elements `t : Finset R`
whose basic opens cover `Spec R` (`Ideal.span t = ⊤`), with each basic open `D(r)`
(`r ∈ t`) contained in some member `q.X i` of the presentation cover.

This is the topological "finite-cover front" of `lem:exists_isIso_fromTildeΓ_basicOpen_cover`:
quasi-compactness of `Spec R` plus the basic-open basis (`PrimeSpectrum.isBasis_basic_opens`)
refine `q.X` to a finite basic-open subcover; the cover condition `q.coversTop` is read off the
`Opens.grothendieckTopology` sieve via `Sieve.mem_ofObjects_iff`, and finiteness is extracted
through `Ideal.span_eq_top_iff_finite`. To obtain `q` from `[M.IsQuasicoherent]`, take
`‹M.IsQuasicoherent›.nonempty_quasicoherentData.some`.

The remaining (heavy) step toward gap1 — transporting each presentation `q.presentation i`
of `M.over (q.X i)` across `D(r) ≅ Spec R_r` to `IsIso ((M|_{D(r)}).fromTildeΓ)` — is the

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — the over-site ↔ open-subspace sheaf equivalence

The gap1 slice-to-geometric bridge `lem:over_restrict_iso` (`overRestrictIso`) rests on an
equivalence of *sheaf* categories
`Sheaf ((Opens.grothendieckTopology X).over U) A ≌ Sheaf (Opens.grothendieckTopology ↥U) A`
induced by the equivalence of underlying sites
`Opens.overEquivalence U : Over U ≌ Opens ↥U`. Mathlib carries `Opens.overEquivalence` but leaves
the *continuity* of its two functors and the induced sheaf-category equivalence as an explicit TODO
(see `Mathlib/Topology/Sheaves/Over.lean`: "show that both functors of the equivalence
`overEquivalence U` are continuous and induce an equivalence between
`Sheaf ((Opens.grothendieckTopology X).over U) A` and `Sheaf (Opens.grothendieckTopology U) A`").

This section fills that TODO. The two cover-lifting (`IsCocontinuous`) facts are the substance:
a sieve covers in the Grothendieck-topology-over-`U` exactly when its image under the slice
forgetful functor covers in the ambient space, and that condition matches the pointwise covering
condition on the open subspace `↥U` because `Subtype.val : ↥U → X` is an injective open embedding.
From the two cocontinuities, `Equivalence.isDenseSubsite_inverse_of_isCocontinuous` produces the
dense-subsite hypothesis and `Equivalence.sheafCongr` produces the sheaf equivalence.

It is the foundational (purely topological / topos-theoretic) layer of the slice-to-geometric
transport; the remaining steps toward `overRestrictIso` (identifying the sliced structure sheaf
`O_X.over U` with the open subscheme's structure sheaf `U.toScheme.ringCatSheaf` under this
equivalence, then lifting to sheaves of modules via `pushforwardPushforwardEquivalence` and relating
to `Scheme.Modules.restrictFunctor U.ι`) are the geometric layer above it. -/

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — the slice-to-geometric module bridge (gap1, C)

This section builds the geometric layer of the gap1 slice-to-geometric bridge
`lem:over_restrict_iso` on top of the topological `overEquivalence_sheafCongr` of the previous
section. It identifies, on the level of *sheaves of modules*, the abstract Grothendieck-slice
restriction `M.over U` (a sheaf of modules over the sliced structure sheaf `O_X.over U` on the slice
site `J.over U`) with the geometric restriction `(restrictFunctor U.ι).obj M` on the small Zariski
site of the open subscheme `U.toScheme`.

The key structural facts, all holding *definitionally* at the pinned commit, are:
* `(Opens.overEquivalence U).inverse ⋙ Over.forget U = U.ι.opensFunctor` (`rfl`): the inverse leg
  of the site equivalence, post-composed with the slice-forgetful functor, is the opens functor of
  the open immersion `U.ι`;
* consequently `U.toScheme.ringCatSheaf = (overEquivalence_sheafCongr U RingCat).functor.obj
  (X.ringCatSheaf.over U)` (`rfl`): the structure sheaf of the open subscheme is the transport of
  the sliced structure sheaf across the ring-valued sheaf equivalence (this is *step 2*, the
  geometric ring-sheaf identification, discharged by `rfl`).

From these, `SheafOfModules.pushforwardPushforwardEquivalence` lifts the site equivalence to an
equivalence of categories of sheaves of modules (`overRestrictEquiv`, *step 3*), under whose functor
the sliced module `M.over U` corresponds to the geometric restriction (`overRestrictIso`, *step 4*).

Mathlib (at the pinned commit) supplies only the underlying site equivalence and the
`pushforward`/`restrictFunctor` machinery; the assembly is project-local. -/

/-- **The slice-to-geometric equivalence of categories of sheaves of modules** (gap1, C, step 3).

For a scheme `X` and an open `U ⊆ X`, the category of sheaves of modules over the sliced structure
sheaf `O_X.over U` on the slice site `J.over U` is equivalent to the category `U.toScheme.Modules`
of sheaves of modules on the open subscheme `U.toScheme`. The equivalence is obtained by lifting the
topological site equivalence `Opens.overEquivalence U` (and its ring-valued sheaf congruence
`overEquivalence_sheafCongr`) to sheaves of modules via
`SheafOfModules.pushforwardPushforwardEquivalence`; the two ring-sheaf comparison morphisms it
consumes are the (co)unit of `Opens.overEquivalence U` whiskered into the structure presheaf, and
the identity (the geometric structure sheaf being *definitionally* the transport of the sliced one).

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — slice-to-geometric presentation transport (gap1, P1)

This section builds the geometric milestone of the gap1 per-element transport
`lem:isIso_fromTildeΓ_basicOpen_of_quasicoherent` (P1): a `SheafOfModules.Presentation` of the
abstract Grothendieck-slice restriction `M.over U` is transported, across the slice-to-geometric
bridge `overRestrictPullbackIso` (gap1, C), into a `SheafOfModules.Presentation` of the *geometric*
restriction `(Scheme.Modules.pullback U.ι).obj M = U.ι^* M` on the open subscheme `U.toScheme`.

The load-bearing ingredient is the unit-iso `overRestrictUnitIso`: the slice-to-geometric
equivalence functor `(overRestrictEquiv U).functor` (definitionally a `SheafOfModules.pushforward`
along the equivalence-of-sites inverse with the *identity* ring comparison) sends the
structure-sheaf module `unit` to `unit`. This is exactly the `F.obj (unit R) ≅ unit S` datum that
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.map` consumes; once it is in hand, `Presentation.map` +
`Presentation.ofIsIso` (across `overRestrictPullbackIso`) realise the transport. The unit-iso rests
on the general fact `isIso_unitToPushforwardObjUnit_of_isIso'`: the canonical map
`unit S ⟶ (pushforward ψ).obj (unit R)` is an iso whenever the ring-sheaf comparison `ψ` is
(here `ψ = 𝟙`).

Mathlib (at the pinned commit) supplies `SheafOfModules.unitToPushforwardObjUnit` and proves it iso
only under a finality hypothesis on the site functor (`PullbackFree.lean`); the
`IsIso ψ ⟹ IsIso (unitToPushforwardObjUnit ψ)` route used here, and the slice transport, are
project-local. -/

`unitToPushforwardObjUnit ψ : unit S ⟶ (pushforward ψ).obj (unit R)` is an isomorphism. Its

Given a sheaf of modules `M` on `X`, an open `U ⊆ X`, and a `SheafOfModules.Presentation` of the

*geometric* restriction `(pullback U.ι).obj M = U.ι^* M` on the open subscheme `U.toScheme`. The
transport is `Presentation.map` along the slice-to-geometric equivalence functor (using the unit-iso
`overRestrictUnitIso`) followed by `Presentation.ofIsIso` across the bridge
`overRestrictPullbackIso` (gap1, C).

This closes the slice-touching step of the gap1 per-element transport
`lem:isIso_fromTildeΓ_basicOpen_of_quasicoherent` (P1): with `U = q.X i` and
`P = q.presentation i` it produces a global presentation of `U.ι^* M`; the remaining geometric step

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — basic-open presentation descent (gap1, P1 keystone)

This section assembles the gap1 per-element keystone
`lem:isIso_fromTildeΓ_basicOpen_of_quasicoherent`
(`isIso_fromTildeΓ_restrict_basicOpen`): on a basic open `D(r)` contained in a cover member
`q.X i` of the quasi-coherence data, the restricted sheaf `M|_{D(r)}` is a geometric tilde, i.e.
its `fromTildeΓ` counit is an isomorphism.

The route follows the affine descent of the recipe, building on the slice-to-geometric presentation
transport of the previous section:

1. `presentationPullbackιOfQuasicoherentData M q i` is a *global* `Presentation` of the geometric
   restriction `N := (q.X i).ι^* M` on the open subscheme `Z := (q.X i).toScheme`.
2. For any open `W ⊆ Z`, the global presentation `PN` slices to a slice presentation `N.over W` via
   the single `Presentation.map` of the over-functor `pushforward (𝟙 …)` (the
   `QuasicoherentData.ofPresentation` template — no iterated-slice equivalence is needed because
   `PN` is already a global presentation on the genuine scheme `Z`).
3. `overRestrictPresentation W N PNW` transports it to a global presentation of the geometric
   restriction `(pullback W.ι).obj N` on the open subscheme `W.toScheme`.
4. For `W` *affine*, `IsAffineOpen.isoSpec` identifies `W.toScheme ≅ Spec Γ(Z, W)`; transporting the
   presentation across this iso (whose `Opens.map` is `Final`, so `pullbackObjUnitToUnit` is an iso)
   lands a global presentation on the genuine affine `Spec Γ(Z, W)`.
5. A global presentation forces `fromTildeΓ` to be an isomorphism
   (`isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_presentation`).

Mathlib (at the pinned commit) carries no `QCoh(Spec R) ≃ Mod R` essential-image bridge; this descent
is project-local. -/

The keystone `isLocalizedModule_basicOpen_descent` reduces (Hartshorne II.5.3 / Stacks
`lemma-invert-f-sections`) to a finite-cover sheaf-gluing argument.  The single geometric input
is the **per-cover-element** fact that on each `D(r)` of a finite cover `{D(r_j)}` of `Spec R`
(with `D(r_j) ≤ q.X i`), the basic-open restriction `Γ(M, D(r)) → Γ(M, D(f) ⊓ D(r))` is a
localization at `powers f` — this is exactly the P1 local-tilde data transported to sections, and
is the gated hypothesis `Hfr` below.  Given `Hfr` (for every `r` whose `D(r)` sits inside a cover
member, hence also for the overlaps `D(r r')`), the descent is pure sheaf theory: separatedness
gives the `exists_of_eq` field, gluing the patched compatible family gives `surj'`, and the global

/-- **Separatedness/torsion field of the section-localization descent.**  Given the
per-cover-element localization data `Hfr` (on each `D(r)` of a finite basic-open cover `{D(r)}` of
`Spec R`, the restriction `Γ(M, D(r)) → Γ(M, D(f) ⊓ D(r))` is a localization at `powers f`), any
global section `x` that restricts to `0` on `D(f)` is killed by a power of `f`.  This is the
`exists_of_eq` engine of `isLocalizedModule_basicOpen_descent`: per cover element a power of `f`
kills `x|_{D(r)}` (`IsLocalizedModule.exists_of_eq` of `Hfr`), the finite sup of these powers kills
every `x|_{D(r)}`, and sheaf separatedness over the cover (`TopCat.Sheaf.eq_of_locally_eq'`) lifts
this to `f^n • x = 0`.  Project-local: the geometric content (`Hfr`) is the gated P1 tilde data. -/

/-- **Surjectivity field of the section-localization descent.**  With the per-cover-element (and
per-overlap) localization data `Hfr`, every section `y` over `D(f)` becomes, after multiplying by a
power of `f`, the restriction of a global section.  The classical Hartshorne II.5.3 argument: each
`D(r)` of a finite basic-open cover `{D(r)}` of `Spec R`, `y|_{D(f) ⊓ D(r)}` is `f^{-N}` times the
restriction of a section `b_r` on `D(r)` (`IsLocalizedModule.surj` of `Hfr` at `D(r)`, with a common
power `N`); on overlaps the `b_r` agree after a further power `f^P` (`descent_overlap_agree` +
`IsLocalizedModule.exists_of_eq` of `Hfr` at `D(r) ⊓ D(r')`), so `f^P • b_r` glue
(`TopCat.Sheaf.existsUnique_gluing'`) to a global `x` with `x|_{D(f)} = f^{N+P} • y` (by sheaf
separatedness over the cover `{D(f) ⊓ D(r)}` of `D(f)`).  Project-local: `Hfr` is the gated P1

/-- **Section-localization descent from a local-tilde cover (gap1 keystone, D), cover form.**  Let
`M` be a sheaf of modules on `Spec R` and `f : R`.  Suppose `{D(r)}_{r ∈ t}` is a finite basic-open
cover of `Spec R` (`Ideal.span t = ⊤`) and for every open `U` contained in some cover member `D(r)`
(in particular each `D(r)` and each overlap `D(r) ⊓ D(r')`) the basic-open restriction
`Γ(M, U) → Γ(M, D(f) ⊓ U)` is a localization at `powers f` (`Hfr` — the gated P1 local-tilde data).
Then the section restriction `Γ(M, ⊤) → Γ(M, D(f))` is `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R`.

This is the project-internal finite-equalizer/flatness descent of Stacks `lemma-invert-f-sections`

/-- **Section-localization descent from a local-tilde cover, basic-open hypothesis form.**

Same conclusion as `isLocalizedModule_basicOpen_descent_of_cover`, but the per-cover-element
localization data `Hfr` need only be supplied for *basic* opens `D(s) ≤ D(r)` (rather than every
open `U ≤ D(r)`).  This is the **instantiable** form of the cover-descent: the per-element P1
transport produces a localization only on the basic opens of the affine slice `Spec R_r` — a general
open of `Spec R_r` need not be quasi-compact, so the global Stacks `lemma-invert-f-sections` is
unavailable for it — while the sheaf-gluing engines `descent_surj`/`descent_smul_eq_zero` only ever
consult `Hfr` at the basic opens `D(r)` and the overlaps `D(r) ⊓ D(r') = D(r·r')`.

It rebuilds the three `IsLocalizedModule` fields directly: `map_units` is
`map_units_restrict_basicOpen` (holds for arbitrary `M`), `surj` is `descent_surj` fed the basic-open
`Hfr` (the open `U` it consults is always `D(s)`, so `Hfr s` supplies the datum after `U = D(s)` is

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — `IsLocalizedModule` transport for gap1-D Hfr

The section-transport iso `gammaPullbackImageIso` is only an additive-group (`Ab`) isomorphism,
semilinear over the *source-scheme* section ring, whereas the `Hfr` hypothesis of
`isLocalizedModule_basicOpen_descent_of_cover` is an `IsLocalizedModule` statement `R`-linear over
the base ring `R`. Two Mathlib-absent transport ingredients bridge the gap:

* **(I)** `isLocalizedModule_of_ringEquiv_semilinear` — transport `IsLocalizedModule S g` across a
  ring-iso-`σ`-semilinear `AddEquiv` pair. Mathlib only has the same-ring `of_linearEquiv` /
  `of_linearEquiv_right`; the section iso crosses a ring iso, so this is the genuine gap.
* **(II)** `isLocalizedModule_restrictScalars_powers_algebraMap` — a localization at
  `powers (algebraMap R Rr f)` over a base-changed ring `Rr` (here `R` localized at `r`) is, after
  restriction of scalars, a localization at `powers f` over `R`.

Both are pure module algebra and Mathlib-absent at the pinned commit; project-bespoke. -/

map `g` with the `eᵢ` (`h (e₁ x) = e₂ (g x)`), the map `h` is a localization at the image submonoid
`S.map σ`. Mathlib only provides the same-ring `IsLocalizedModule.of_linearEquiv`; this crosses a
ring iso, the form needed to turn the `Ab`/semilinear section iso `gammaPullbackImageIso` into the

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — gap1-D Hfr: pullback-section transport

The remaining gated ingredient of the named gap1 keystone
`isLocalizedModule_basicOpen_descent` is the **section-level** analogue of P1's object-level
transport: for an open immersion `f : X ⟶ Y` and a sheaf of modules `M` on `Y`, the sections of the
geometric pullback `(pullback f).obj M` over an open `U ⊆ X` are canonically identified with the
sections of `M` over the image `f ''ᵁ U`.

The construction is `Γ(-, U)` applied to the inverse of Mathlib's `restrictFunctorIsoPullback f`
(`restrictFunctor f ≅ pullback f`) at `M`, using the *definitional* identity
`Γ((restrictFunctor f).obj M, U) = Γ(M, f ''ᵁ U)` (`Scheme.Modules.restrict_obj`, `rfl`). Because
both sides are `Γ(-, U)` of a single fixed module isomorphism, naturality in `U` (intertwining the
presheaf restriction maps) is free: it is the naturality of the underlying abelian-presheaf
morphism. Mathlib-absent at the pinned commit; project-bespoke. -/

/-- **(I)+(II) combined: ring-iso-semilinear localization transport descending to the base ring.**

Given a base ring `R`, an `R`-algebra `A`, a ring iso `σ : S ≃+* A` carrying `f' : S` to
`algebraMap R A f`, a localization `g` at `powers f'` over `S`, two `σ`-semilinear additive
isomorphisms `e₁, e₂` onto `A`-modules (also `R`-modules via the scalar tower `R → A`), and an
`A`-linear map `h` intertwining `g` with the `eᵢ` (`h (e₁ x) = e₂ (g x)`), the restriction of
scalars of `h` to `R` is a localization at `powers f` over `R`.

This is the algebra core of the gap1 `Hfr` transport: bridge (I)
(`isLocalizedModule_of_ringEquiv_semilinear`) moves the localization across the ring iso to
`powers (algebraMap R A f)` over `A`, then bridge (II)

immersion `j : Spec S ⟶ Spec R` with `IsIso (fromTildeΓ ((pullback j).obj M))` (the P1 datum), a
ring element `f : R` and a slice element `f' : S` whose appIso-transport is the restriction of `f`
(`hf'`), and target opens `U = j ''ᵁ ⊤`, `V = j ''ᵁ D(f')`, the section restriction
`Γ(M, U) → Γ(M, V)` is `IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `R`.

The proof assembles the P1 object-level `IsIso fromTildeΓ` into a section-level localization via the
algebra combiner `isLocalizedModule_powers_transport`: the engine
`isLocalizedModule_restrict_of_isIso_fromTildeΓ` localizes `Γ(M',⊤) → Γ(M', D(f'))` over the slice
ring `S`; the `σ`-semilinear section isos `e₁ = gammaPullbackImageIso ⊤`,
`e₂ = gammaPullbackImageIso D(f')` (over `σ = (ΓSpecIso S)⁻¹ ≪≫ gammaImageRingEquiv ⊤`) and the
restriction map `h` intertwine it, and the combiner descends the result to `powers f` over `R`.
Finally the `j ''ᵁ`-form opens are transported to `U` / `V` via `eT`, `eB`.  `j` is kept abstract so
the section-ring defeqs stay cheap.

/-! ## Project-local Mathlib supplement — gap2 single-chart transport

The general-scheme keystone `lem:qcoh_section_localization_basicOpen`
(`isLocalizedModule_basicOpen`): for a quasi-coherent sheaf of modules `M` on an *arbitrary* scheme
`X`, an affine open `U`, and `f : Γ(X, U)`, the section restriction `Γ(M, U) → Γ(M, D(f))` is
`IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `Γ(X, U)`.

It is the single-chart affine transport on top of G1-core: pull `M` back along the affine immersion
`hU.fromSpec : Spec Γ(X, U) ⟶ X` (range `U`), so the pullback `M'` is quasi-coherent on
`Spec Γ(X, U)`, where gap1 gives `IsIso M'.fromTildeΓ`; the engine
`isLocalizedModule_restrict_of_isIso_fromTildeΓ` localizes the slice restriction over `Γ(X, U)`, and
the `σ`-semilinear section comparison `gammaPullbackImageIso` (bridge (I)
`isLocalizedModule_of_ringEquiv_semilinear`) transports it to the `M`-side restriction. No
cover-and-glue: `U` is already affine, so there is a single chart. -/

/-- **`fromSpec`-section coherence** (gap2 transport crux). For an affine open `U` of a scheme `X`,
the `eqToHom`-transport `Γ(X, hU.fromSpec ''ᵁ ⊤) → Γ(X, U)` (along the equality
`hU.fromSpec ''ᵁ ⊤ = U`) equals the composite ring iso
`(hU.fromSpec.appIso ⊤).hom ≫ (ΓSpecIso Γ(X, U)).hom`. Equivalently, the section ring iso
`σ = (ΓSpecIso)⁻¹ ≫ gammaImageRingEquiv (fromSpec) ⊤` underlying the gap2 section comparison is, up to
this `eqToHom` transport, the identity. This is the coherence needed to read the gap2-core

/-- **(gap2 core) Basic-open section localization along an abstract affine open immersion.** For an
open immersion `j : Spec S ⟶ X` with the P1 datum `IsIso (fromTildeΓ ((pullback j).obj M))`, a slice
element `f' : S`, and `f : Γ(X, j ''ᵁ ⊤)` with `σ f' = f` (`σ = (ΓSpecIso S)⁻¹ ≫ gammaImageRingEquiv
j ⊤`), the section restriction `Γ(M, j ''ᵁ ⊤) → Γ(M, j ''ᵁ D(f'))` is
`IsLocalizedModule (powers f)` over `Γ(X, j ''ᵁ ⊤)`.

The proof mirrors `section_localization_hfr_aux` but over an arbitrary ambient scheme `X` (so the
localization ring is the *local* section ring `A = Γ(X, j ''ᵁ ⊤)`, not a global `R`): the engine
`isLocalizedModule_restrict_of_isIso_fromTildeΓ` localizes the slice restriction `g` over `S`, the
`σ`-semilinear section comparisons `e₁, e₂` (`gammaPullbackImageIso`) intertwine `g` with the
`M`-side restriction `h = restrictₗ M ii`, and bridge (I)
`isLocalizedModule_of_ringEquiv_semilinear` transports the localization across `σ`, landing
`powers ((powers f').map σ) = powers (σ f') = powers f`. Because the base and target rings coincide
(`R = A`), no `restrictScalars` base-change (bridge II) is needed. Project-local. -/

satisfies `IdealSheafData.map_ideal_basicOpen` at *every* affine open. That coherence is
`annihilator_map_basicOpen`, which needs finite generation of `Γ(F, V)` at each `V`; hence the

/-- **Spec-level pullback-of-tilde formula** (iter-187 Lane F NAMED HELPER,
project-side typed-sorry).

For a ring map `φ : A ⟶ B` of commutative rings, the module-sheaf pullback
along `Spec.map φ : Spec B ⟶ Spec A` sends `tilde M` to (the `tilde` of)
the base-change module `M ⊗_A B` on `Spec B`. This is the substantive
Mathlib gap (Stacks tag 01HQ / 0BJ8): the "pullback of tilde = tilde of
base change" identification.

Direct LSP searches (iter-187 analogist, `quotscheme-isbasechange-tilde.md`)
confirm Mathlib (pinned commit `b80f227`) has no such lemma; the only
pullback formula at all is `pullbackObjFreeIso` on *free* sheaves
(`PullbackFree.lean:122`), too restrictive for general modules.

This declaration is the project-side named pin capturing the Mathlib gap.
Its `Nonempty` form sidesteps the noncomputable / data choice issue: the

PROVED (T12 session, 2026-07-03). The body assembles the union-merge
substrate: quasi-coherence of the pullback (`isQuasicoherent_pullback_fromSpec`,
Piece A) feeds the affine structure theorem (`isIso_fromTildeΓ_of_isQuasicoherent`,
gap1) to invert the tilde–Γ counit; the Σ-pair base map is bijective because,
through Mathlib's `Adjunction.unit_leftAdjointUniq_hom_app` (the two adjunctions
share the right adjoint `pushforward j`), it factors as (restriction-adjunction
unit component = presheaf restriction along `j ''ᵁ j ⁻¹ᵁ V = V`) ∘ (component of
the `restrictFunctorIsoPullback` natural isomorphism) ∘ (restriction along
`⊤ ≤ j ⁻¹ᵁ V = ⊤`). The iso is `(tilde.map b' ≫ fromTildeΓ)⁻¹`, and the

This pin captures the Step 3 transport content of the Tilde-isoTop route:
the top section of a sheaf pulled back along
`IsAffineOpen.fromSpec : Spec Γ(Y, U) ⟶ Y` is canonically `Γ(Y, U)`-linearly
identified with the section over `U` itself. Substantive content combines

`pullback` functor with the `restrict` functor along an open immersion;

/-- **Section-level LinearEquiv via the Tilde route** (iter-188 Lane F NAMED
HELPER, iter-189 unbundling refactor).

The substantive transport-and-intertwining helper: given a morphism `g : Y ⟶ X`
of schemes, a quasi-coherent module `N` on `X`, and affine opens
`V ⊆ X`, `U ⊆ Y` with `U ⊆ g⁻¹ V`, produces:
- a `Γ(Y, U)`-linear equiv between `TensorProduct Γ(X, V) Γ(Y, U) Γ(N, V)`
  and `Γ((pullback g).obj N, U)`, and
- a proof that this equiv sends `1 ⊗ x` to `pullback_app_isoTensor_baseMap g N e x`
  (the Beck-Chevalley compatibility).

The construction follows the iter-187 analogist-licensed Tilde route
(`analogies/quotscheme-isbasechange-tilde.md`):
  Step 1: identify `N|_V ≅ tilde Γ(N, V)` on `Spec Γ(X, V)` using
    `[N.IsQuasicoherent]` (extract a presentation on the affine open
    after transporting via `hV.isoSpec`).
  Step 2: pull back via `Spec.map φ : Spec Γ(Y, U) ⟶ Spec Γ(X, V)`,
    where `φ = g.appLE V U e`; apply `pullback_tildeIso` to obtain
    `(pullback (Spec.map φ)).obj (tilde Γ(N, V)) ≅
      tilde (Γ(Y, U) ⊗ Γ(N, V))` on `Spec Γ(Y, U)`.
  Step 3: transport via `hU.isoSpec` back to `U`-sections of
    `(pullback g).obj N`.
  Step 4: evaluate at `⊤` via `tilde.isoTop` to extract the section-level
    linear equiv.
  Step 5: verify the intertwining via naturality of the adjunction unit
    (the Beck-Chevalley compatibility check; ~30-50 LOC).

The substantive Mathlib gap content (Stacks 01HQ "pullback of tilde =
tilde of base change", plus the affine-open / Spec transport) is
factored into the present helper's body as a typed sorry. Once
`pullback_tildeIso` lands axiom-clean (iter-189+ sub-build) and the
transport infrastructure is in place, this helper closes axiom-clean
in ~30-50 LOC. -/

/-- **Substantive `IsBaseChange` claim** for the affine-open section formula
(iter-187 Lane F — analogist-informed refactor; iter-188 closes axiom-clean
via the named section-LinearEquiv helper).

Per iter-187 analogist verdict (`analogies/quotscheme-isbasechange-tilde.md`):
the iso comes from the named Spec-level helper `pullback_tildeIso`
combined with `TensorProduct.isBaseChange` + `IsBaseChange.of_equiv`; the
substantive Mathlib gap (Stacks tag 01HQ / 0BJ8: "pullback of tilde =
tilde of base change") is *factored* into the standalone helper
`pullback_tildeIso` above.

The hypothesis `[N.IsQuasicoherent]` is added per analogist Decision 3:
the Tilde-route strictly requires `N|_V ∈ essImage tilde` on
`Spec(Γ(X, V))`, which follows from quasi-coherence + `hV.isoSpec`.

**iter-188 closure**: body assembled via the named helper
`pullback_app_isoTensor_baseMap_sectionLinearEquiv` (which packages the
LinearEquiv with the intertwining property) combined with

/-- **Affine-base case of flat base change at affine opens** (Stacks tag 02KH).

Specialization of `canonicalBaseChangeMap_app_app_isIso_of_isAffineOpen` to
the case where the *base* `S` is affine, so we may take `V := ⊤ : S.Opens`
as the (trivially affine) compatible open: every affine `U ⊆ S'` satisfies
`U ≤ (Opens.map g.base).obj ⊤ = ⊤`.

iter-187 Lane F (analogist-informed REFACTOR, per
`analogies/quotscheme-isbasechange-tilde.md` Decision 1): the
prior iter-186 framing routed through `Module.Flat.isBaseChange`,
which is a **category mistake** — that Mathlib lemma is a *consumer*
of `IsBaseChange` (it propagates flatness *across* a given IsBaseChange
witness, Stacks 00H8 in the conclusion direction), NOT a producer.
The corrected route uses `pullback_app_isoTensor g' …` directly: the
section-level iso is `(pullback_app_isoTensor g' …).symm`, and the
residual gap is *Beck–Chevalley compatibility* (the canonical BC arrow
agrees with the section-formula iso under the `pushforward_obj_obj`-rfl
identification) plus the section-vs-tensor-product Tilde-isoTop content
(now factored into `pullback_tildeIso`).

iter-187 Lane F adds `[F.IsQuasicoherent]` per analogist Decision 3:
this is the standard Stacks 02KH hypothesis on the input sheaf `F`. Via
`pushforward_isQuasicoherent` (named project-side helper for Stacks
01XJ), it propagates to `((pushforward f).obj F).IsQuasicoherent`, which
is what `pullback_app_isoTensor` needs.

The body's substantive content is now fully encapsulated in
`pullback_app_isoTensor` (LHS) and in `pullback_tildeIso` (the genuine
Mathlib gap). The Beck-Chevalley compatibility residual is iter-188+
~30-50 LOC of route-stitching. -/

/-- **Affine-open form of flat base change** (Stacks tag 00H8 / 02KE).

Restriction of `canonicalBaseChangeMap_app_app_isIso` to the case where the
open `U ⊆ S'` is affine. The general (non-affine base `S`) case factors into:
(i) the affine-base specialization
`canonicalBaseChangeMap_app_app_isIso_of_isAffineOpen_of_isAffineBase`, which
captures the substantive Stacks 02KE algebraic content via
`Module.Flat.isBaseChange`; and
(ii) a base-side Mayer-Vietoris descent step (refining `U` along an affine
cover `(V_α)_α` of `S` into pieces `U ∩ (Opens.map g.base).obj V_α`, applying
(i) on each, and gluing via `QuasiSeparated f`).

iter-181 Lane F: helper-with-substantive-Mathlib-gap. The body is a typed
`sorry` carrying the *intended* base-side Mayer-Vietoris reduction; the
algebraic Stacks 02KE content is delegated to

Concretely the body would:
  1. Choose a finite affine cover `(V_α)_α` of `S` whose union covers
     `g.base '' U.carrier` (using quasi-compactness of `U`).
  2. Refine `U` into pieces `W_α := U ⊓ (Opens.map g.base).obj V_α`,
     each affine when intersected with the affine open `(g)⁻¹ V_α`.
  3. On each piece, restrict the morphism `g` to `g|_{(g)⁻¹ V_α} :
     (g)⁻¹ V_α ⟶ V_α` (still flat) and apply the affine-base helper to
     conclude iso at `W_α`.
  4. Descend along the cover `(W_α)_α` of `U` via Mayer-Vietoris on the
     quasi-separated `f` (the intersection `W_α ∩ W_β` is quasi-compact). -/

/-- **Open-cover gluing for the section-wise flat base change**
(Mayer-Vietoris reduction, Stacks 02KH(ii) corollary).

If the section of the canonical base-change map is an iso over *every*
affine open `V ⊆ S'`, then it is an iso over every open `U ⊆ S'` as well.
This is the standard Mayer-Vietoris descent argument for a morphism of
quasi-coherent sheaves on the base: pick an affine cover of `U`, the
morphism is an iso on each chart, hence iso on `U` by gluing along the
intersections (which are quasi-compact thanks to `QuasiSeparated f`).

iter-180 Lane F: helper-with-substantive-Mathlib-gap. The body is a typed
`sorry` carrying the *intended* descent argument. Required ingredients
(not yet in scope at the pinned Mathlib commit):
* the basis property of affine opens (`Scheme.affineOpenCover`);
* iso-on-basis ⟹ iso-on-open for sheaves of modules

/-- **Section-wise form of flat base change** (Stacks tag 02KH(ii)).

For every open `U` of `S'`, the section over `U` of the canonical base-change
map `(pullback g).obj ((pushforward f).obj F) ⟶ (pushforward f').obj ((pullback g').obj F)`
is an isomorphism.

This is the substantive content of Stacks 02KH(ii) (the `i = 0` form), and
splits cleanly into two named substantive Mathlib gaps:
* `canonicalBaseChangeMap_app_app_isIso_of_isAffineOpen` — the affine case
  via algebraic flat base change `Module.Flat.isBaseChange` (Stacks 00H8 /
  02KE);
* `canonicalBaseChangeMap_app_app_isIso_of_affineCover` — the descent from
  affine opens to arbitrary opens via Mayer-Vietoris on the quasi-separated
  morphism `f`.

The body of this theorem composes the two helpers cleanly; the substantive
content has been factored into the helper bodies. -/
