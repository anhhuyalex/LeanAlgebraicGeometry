# FGA representability of the Picard scheme (A.2.c)

This file is the **A.2.c** assembly chapter for the project's positive-genus
arm of `nonempty_jacobianWitness`. It states the FGA representability of the
relative Picard functor of a smooth proper geometrically integral curve
`C/k`, following Kleiman, "The Picard scheme", §2 and §4 (cf. FGA Explained
Ch. 9; arXiv:math/0504020).

## Status (run-0008 rewire — `picSharp` is now the REAL relative functor)

The former §0 placeholder (`picSharp` as a `Classical.choice` extraction from
a `⟨sorry⟩`-backed `Nonempty` typeclass, with **no defining property**) has
been replaced: `picSharp C` is now **defined** as the honest relative Picard
functor

```
picSharp C := PicSharp.relPresheaf C ⋙ forget AddCommGrpCat
```

on the `H_T`-coset carrier `T ↦ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)` of sibling
`Picard/RelPicFunctor.lean` (§4b there; blueprint
`def:rel_pic_sharp` after the coordinated repin). Consequently the
representability statements below have actual mathematical content: the
`RepresentableBy` witness extracted from `representable C` is a genuine
natural bijection `(T ⟶ Pic_{C/k}) ≃ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)`, which is
what the downstream tangent-space computation (`AJC.pic0av`,
`Pic0.tangentSpaceIso`) attaches to.

## The étale-sheafification route: Kleiman §2 Thm 2.5 (route (b))

Kleiman §4 represents the **étale-sheafified** functor `Pic_{(C/k)ét}`.
Mathlib at the pinned revision has no étale Grothendieck topology on
schemes, so instead of sheafifying we use Kleiman §2 **Thm 2.5**: when
`f : X → S` has a **section** and `O_S = f_* O_X` holds universally (true
for our proper geometrically integral `C/k`), the comparison maps

```
Pic_{X/S}(T) → Pic_{(X/S)ét}(T) → Pic_{(X/S)fppf}(T)
```

are all **bijective**. Hence, under a `k`-rational-point hypothesis
(`HasRationalPoint C` below), the *plain* relative functor `picSharp C` is
itself representable, and the FGA statement can be made against it directly
— no étale topology needed. Without a section the plain functor is NOT
representable in general (it need not even be a Zariski sheaf), which is why
the representability sorry `instHasPicScheme` below is **conditional on
`[HasRationalPoint C]`**: an unconditional instance would assert a false
statement. (Run-0008 memory `I-0061`: the same trap ruled out wiring
`picSharp` to the *absolute* functor `PicSharp.presheaf`.)

## Sorry accounting after the rewires (run 0008 `picSharp`, run 0010 fga-div,
run 0011 Abel map)

The file has exactly **one** remaining sorry site, a `⟨sorry⟩` instance
constructor of a `Prop`-valued class:

1. `instHasPicScheme` — the single genuine **FGA sorry**: existence of a
   representing scheme for `picSharp C`, **locally of finite type over `k`**,
   given a rational point (Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1) + Cor `cor:algsch`,
   transported through §2 Thm 2.5). Run 0010 strengthened the existential to
   also carry local finiteness — part (1) of the same Kleiman theorem, one
   existence package — absorbing the former separate
   `instPicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType` sorry.

`instHasAbelMap` is now **CLOSED** (run 0011): `HasAbelMap` is repinned from a
`Prop`-valued `Nonempty (divFunctor C ⟶ picSharp C)` gate to a data-carrying
class with field `abel`, and the instance supplies the **substantive** Abel map
`abelMapWitness C = abelKernelNatTrans C ≫ picNeg C`, `[D] ↦ [O(D)] = -[ker q]`.
`abelMap` therefore acquires a genuine defining property `abelMap_app_mk`
(no longer an opaque `Classical.choice` of a `Nonempty`).

Everything else is REAL or PROVED:

* `picSharp` — REAL (run 0008), the relative Picard functor.
* `divFunctor` — REAL (run 0010): the relative-divisor functor
  `Scheme.DivFunctor C.hom` of `Picard/DivFunctorDef.lean` (Kleiman §3
  Def. `df:div`, invertible-kernel quotient encoding); consequently
  `instHasDivFunctor` is **PROVED** (witness: `divFunctor C`).
* `instPicSharpRepresentable` — **PROVED** (`Exists.choose_spec.1`): the
  scheme chosen by `PicScheme` represents `picSharp C` by construction.
* `instPicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType` — **PROVED** (run 0010,
  `Exists.choose_spec.2`): local finiteness is the second component of the
  strengthened `HasPicScheme` existential.
* `groupSchemeStructure` — **PROVED** via `GrpObj.ofRepresentableBy`:
  Yoneda transport of the abelian-group structure of `relPresheaf`.
* `smoothProperQuotient` — the Altman–Kleiman quotient lemma is kept as a
  theorem extracting from an explicit **use-site hypothesis class**
  `HasSmoothProperQuotient`. The former GLOBAL `⟨sorry⟩` instance was
  **deleted in run 0008**: it asserted `P.IsRepresentable` for *every*
  presheaf morphism `α : Z ⟶ P`, which is flagrantly false. Even the
  theorem's hypothesis list is weaker than Kleiman §4 Lem `lm:qt` (it
  omits quasi-projectivity of the representing scheme `Y`, not currently
  expressible in Mathlib — no `QuasiProjective` vocabulary), and with the
  étale-local lift hypothesis a Hironaka-type free ℤ/2-action on a smooth
  proper 3-fold gives a smooth proper equivalence relation whose quotient
  sheaf is an algebraic space that is NOT a scheme. The class must
  therefore be supplied at the use site, where quasi-projectivity of the
  Abel-map slice is available.

`picSharp` is the honest relative Picard functor of sibling
`Picard/RelPicFunctor.lean` (Kleiman §2 Def `df:Pfs`), with the group
structure forgotten (representability is a statement about the underlying
set-valued functor; the group structure is transported back onto the
representing scheme by `groupSchemeStructure` below).

`divFunctor` (the relative-effective-divisor functor `Div_{C/k}`, Kleiman §3
Def `df:div`) is, since run 0010, the REAL functor `Scheme.DivFunctor C.hom`
of sibling `Picard/DivFunctorDef.lean` (A.2.b), replacing the former
`⟨sorry⟩`-backed opaque carrier. -/

/-- **The relative Picard functor** `Pic^♯_{C/k} : (Sch/k)^op ⥤ Type (u+1)`,
`T ↦ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)` — the set-valued shadow of the group-valued
presheaf `PicSharp.relPresheaf` of `Picard/RelPicFunctor.lean` (the honest
`H_T`-coset carrier of Kleiman §2 Def `df:Pfs`).

Run-0008 rewire: this replaces the former opaque
`Classical.choice`-of-`⟨sorry⟩` placeholder; it is now a REAL definition with
computational content, so `RepresentableBy` witnesses against it carry a
genuine natural bijection `(T ⟶ Pic_{C/k}) ≃ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)`.

Universe note: the values live in `Type (u+1)` because the line-bundle
carrier `LineBundle.OnProduct` is a quotient of (large) sheaves of modules.
`Functor.RepresentableBy` is universe-polymorphic, so representability by a
(`Type u`-homed) scheme remains a well-formed — and, under a rational point,
true — statement. -/

`Classical.choice`-of-`⟨sorry⟩` extraction. Natural transformations out of it
(the Abel map `abelMap` below) therefore have actual mathematical content.

/-! ## §1. The Picard scheme

The Picard scheme `Pic_{C/k}` of a smooth proper geometrically integral curve
`C/k` **with a `k`-rational point** is the `k`-scheme representing the
relative Picard functor `picSharp C` (which, under the rational point, agrees
with the étale-sheafified functor of Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main` by Kleiman §2
Thm 2.5). The scheme is separated, locally of finite type over `k`, and a
disjoint union of open quasi-projective `k`-subschemes; the
abelian-group-scheme structure is `groupSchemeStructure` below.

Blueprint reference: `def:pic_scheme` (Kleiman §4 Def. `df:Psch`). -/

/-- Typeclass asserting existence of a scheme over `Spec k` that represents
the relative Picard functor `picSharp C` **and is locally of finite type over

instance below, **conditional on `[HasRationalPoint C]`** — without a section
the plain relative functor is not representable in general, so an
unconditional instance would assert a false statement. Consumers that
quantify over `[HasPicScheme C]` as a hypothesis remain kernel-clean.

Run 0010 strengthening: the existential also carries
`LocallyOfFiniteType X.hom`. This is truth-preserving because Kleiman §4 Thm
`th:main`(1) makes local finiteness part of the SAME existence package as
representability (`Pic_{C/k}` is a disjoint union of open quasi-projective
`k`-subschemes), so the strengthened statement is exactly as true as the old
one; it lets the local-finiteness carrier `instPicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType`
be PROVED by extraction instead of carrying its own sorry. -/

locally of finite type), combined with Kleiman §2 Thm 2.5 (under the
`k`-rational point of `[HasRationalPoint C]`, the plain relative functor
`picSharp C` coincides with the étale-sheafified one, so the same scheme
represents it).

Run 0010: this sorry now also carries Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1) — the
representing scheme is **locally of finite type** over `k` (a disjoint union
of open quasi-projective `k`-subschemes) — since the strengthened
`HasPicScheme` existential packages local finiteness together with
representability; the former separate `instPicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType`
sorry is absorbed into this one.

The conditionality on `[HasRationalPoint C]` is essential for truth: without
a section, `Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)` need not even be a Zariski sheaf. -/

/-! ## §2. The Abel map — line-bundle / Quot correspondence

The bridge from line bundles on `C ×_k T` to the Quot scheme is the **Abel
map**: a relative effective divisor `D ⊆ C ×_k T` over `T` determines a
`T`-point of `Div_{C/k}`, and the dual ideal sheaf
`O_{C ×_k T}(D) := I_D⁻¹` represents a class in `Pic^♯_{C/k}(T)`.

Blueprint reference: `lem:line_bundle_quot_correspondence` (Kleiman §3
Def. `dfn:Abel` + Thm. `th:repDiv`). -/

/-! ### The substantive Abel map (run-0011 closure)

The former `⟨sorry⟩`-backed `Nonempty (divFunctor C ⟶ picSharp C)` carrier is
replaced by the **explicit** natural transformation `abelMapWitness C`, and the
class `HasAbelMap` is repinned to **carry the map itself** (a data field
`abel`, no longer a bare `Prop`), so that `abelMap` acquires a genuine defining
property (`abelMap_app_mk` below) rather than being an opaque `Classical.choice`
of a `Nonempty`.

Construction of `abelMapWitness C : Div_{C/k} ⟶ Pic^♯_{C/k}`, `[D] ↦ [O(D)]`:
a relative effective divisor family `⟨F, q⟩` on `C ×_k T` has invertible ideal
`I_D = ker q`; the Abel map sends its class to
`[O(D)] = [I_D⁻¹] = -[I_D]`, the additive inverse (in the group-valued target
`Pic^♯_{C/k}(T)`) of the class of the ideal sheaf.  It is assembled as the
composite `abelKernelNatTrans C ≫ picNeg C`, where `abelKernelNatTrans` is the
substantive `[D] ↦ [I_D]` transformation and `picNeg` is the (natural)
negation on the group-valued functor.

Naturality of `abelKernelNatTrans` is the mathematical heart: for a test map
`g : T' ⟶ T` the base-change square is cartesian (`quotBaseSquare`), and the
**kernel–pullback comparison** `g_C^*(ker q) ⟶ ker(g_C^* q)` is an isomorphism
under the divisor conditions (`Modules.isIso_pullbackKernelComparison`, whose
side hypotheses — epi `q`, quasi-coherent source, finitely-presented `F`,
`T`-flat `F`, invertible kernel — are exactly the fields of `DivFamily`), so
`ker` commutes with base change and the class `[ker q]` is natural.  Negation
is natural because `Pic^♯`'s pullback maps are group homomorphisms.

The `dual` route (`Modules.dual (ker q)` as an explicit inverse) is available
for the *object-level* invertibility (`dual_isLocallyTrivial`) but is not used
here: the group-inverse `-[ker q]` is the canonical `[I_D⁻¹]` and makes
naturality rest only on the (landed) kernel–pullback comparison, avoiding the
not-yet-formalised sheaf-level dual-pullback commutation.

Blueprint reference: `lem:line_bundle_quot_correspondence` (Kleiman §3
Def. `dfn:Abel`); this instance is the **natural-transformation half** — `Div`
representability (Kleiman §3 Thm. `th:repDiv`) is NOT claimed here. -/

/-- Well-definedness of the ideal-class assignment `⟨F, q⟩ ↦ [ker q]` on the
divisor equivalence relation `DivFamily.Rel`: an equivalence `f : x.F ≅ y.F`
with `x.q ≫ f.hom = y.q` gives `ker x.q ≅ ker y.q` (`kernelCompMono` at the
iso `f.hom`), hence equal `H_T`-coset classes (`relPicRel_of_iso`). -/

`ker((g_C^* x).q) ≅ g_C^*(ker x.q)`.  Proof: `(pullbackAlong g.unop x).q` is
`triangleIso.inv ≫ g_C^*(x.q)`, so its kernel agrees with `ker(g_C^* x.q)`
(`kernelIsIsoComp`, precomposition by the iso `triangleIso.inv`); the
**kernel–pullback comparison** `g_C^*(ker q) ⟶ ker(g_C^* q)` is an isomorphism

/-! ## §3. The smooth-proper quotient lemma — Altman–Kleiman descent

The structural lemma underlying Step 4 of Kleiman §4 Thm. `th:main`: given a
surjection `α : Z ⟶ P` of étale sheaves with `R := Z ×_P Z` representable,
`Z` representable **by a quasi-projective scheme**, and the first projection
`R ⟶ Z` smooth and proper, the quotient `P` is representable.

**Run-0008 restructure (truth audit).** The former global instance
`instHasSmoothProperQuotient : ∀ α, HasSmoothProperQuotient α := ⟨sorry⟩`
asserted that EVERY presheaf receiving any natural transformation is
representable — flagrantly false — and was deleted. Moreover the theorem's
own hypothesis list is strictly weaker than Kleiman §4 Lem `lm:qt`: it lacks
**quasi-projectivity of `Y`** (not currently expressible — Mathlib has no
`QuasiProjective` vocabulary), and without it the statement is false: a
Hironaka-type free `ℤ/2`-action on a smooth proper non-projective 3-fold
gives a smooth proper equivalence relation satisfying hypotheses (1)–(4)
whose quotient étale sheaf is an algebraic space that is not a scheme.

`HasSmoothProperQuotient α` therefore survives only as an **explicit
use-site hypothesis**: the intended consumer (the FGA assembly, Step 4 of
`th:main`) instantiates it for the Abel-map slice `Z ⟶ P^{φ_0}_0`, where `Z`
is a quasi-projective open of `Div_{C/k}` and Altman–Kleiman descent
genuinely applies. Supplying that instance is part of the `instHasPicScheme`
obligation, not a standalone global fact.

/-- Hypothesis class packaging the CONCLUSION of the Altman–Kleiman
smooth-proper quotient lemma for a specific étale-sheaf surjection `α`:
that the target presheaf is representable.

There is deliberately NO global instance (run-0008: the former global
`⟨sorry⟩` instance was a false statement — see the section header). The
class is supplied at the use site, where the Kleiman `lm:qt` hypotheses —
including the quasi-projectivity of the representing scheme, which the
`smoothProperQuotient` statement below cannot yet express — actually hold. -/

/-- **The smooth-proper quotient lemma — Altman–Kleiman descent of an
étale-sheaf surjection** (Kleiman §4 Lem. `lm:qt`).

Let `Z, P : (Sch/k)^op ⥤ Type (u+1)` be presheaves and `α : Z ⟶ P` a natural
transformation with: (1) `Z` representable by `Y`; (2) `R := Z ×_P Z`
representable by `R`; (3) the first projection `π : R ⟶ Y` smooth and proper;
(4) `α` an étale-local surjection (every `T`-point of `P` lifts along some
test morphism). Then, granting the use-site hypothesis
`[HasSmoothProperQuotient α]` (which additionally encodes Kleiman's
quasi-projectivity of `Y` — see the section header for why it cannot yet be
stated internally), `P` is representable.

The Lean body extracts the conclusion from the hypothesis class; the
mathematical content (Altman–Kleiman effective-equivalence-relation descent
+ EGA IV 8.11.5) lives at the use site supplying the instance. -/

/-! ## §4. The FGA representability theorem

Grothendieck's existence theorem for the Picard scheme (Kleiman §4 Thm.
`th:main`, specialised via Cor. `cor:algsch` to `S = Spec k`, `X = C`),
transported through Kleiman §2 Thm 2.5 to the plain relative functor under
the rational-point hypothesis: `picSharp C` is representable by `PicScheme C`.

Blueprint reference: `thm:fga_pic_representability`. -/

/-- Typeclass asserting that `picSharp C` is representable by `PicScheme C`.

Run-0008: this is now PROVED from `HasPicScheme` (the representing witness is
`Classical.choose`-extracted, so its `choose_spec` is exactly this
statement); the class survives only to preserve the blueprint-pinned
consumer signature of `representable`. -/

scheme represents `picSharp C` (the second component, since the run-0010
strengthening, is local finiteness — see

/-- **FGA representability of the Picard scheme.**

Let `k` be a field and `C` a smooth proper geometrically integral curve over
`k` (with, through the `HasPicScheme` hypothesis chain, a `k`-rational
point). Then the relative Picard functor `Pic^♯_{C/k}` is representable by
the Picard scheme `PicScheme C`: there is a natural bijection

```
(T ⟶ Pic_{C/k}) ≃ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)
```

for every `k`-scheme `T`. After the run-0008 rewire this `RepresentableBy`
structure is a genuine comparison against the real relative Picard functor
(not an opaque placeholder), so downstream consumers (tangent-space
computation at the identity, `Pic⁰` degree theory) can compose with its
`homEquiv` to transfer line-bundle data to scheme points. -/

/-! ## §5. The abelian group-scheme structure

The Picard scheme `Pic_{C/k}` inherits an abelian group-scheme structure from
the tensor product of invertible sheaves on `C ×_k T`: the relative Picard
presheaf is group-valued (`PicSharp.relPresheaf`), and a representing object
of (the set-valued shadow of) a group-valued presheaf is canonically a group
object, by Yoneda transport (`GrpObj.ofRepresentableBy`).

Run-0008: with `picSharp` now REALLY equal to `relPresheaf ⋙ forget`, this
transport is a genuine proof, replacing the former `⟨sorry⟩`-backed
`PicSchemeGroupObject` carrier class (deleted).

Blueprint reference: `thm:pic_is_group_scheme` (Kleiman §2 Def. `df:Pfs` +
§4 Def. `df:Psch`). -/

/-- The multiplicative (`CommGrpCat`-valued) avatar of the relative Picard
presheaf, used to feed `GrpObj.ofRepresentableBy` (whose API is

      (α := ((PicSharp.relPresheaf C).obj T : Type (u+1)))))
    (fun _ => rfl)

/-- **The Picard scheme is a commutative `k`-group scheme** — a canonical
`CommGrpObj` structure (i.e. `GrpObj` + `IsCommMonObj`) on `PicScheme C`,
obtained by Yoneda transport (`CommGrpObj.ofRepresentableBy`) of the
abelian-group structure of the relative Picard presheaf
`PicSharp.relPresheaf` along the representability witness `representable C`.
Concretely: `[L] + [M] = [L ⊗ M]`, `-[L] = [L⁻¹]`, unit `[O_{C ×_k T}]`,
transported through `(T ⟶ Pic_{C/k}) ≃ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)`.

Run-0008: this is now a real construction (the former `⟨sorry⟩`-backed
`PicSchemeGroupObject` carrier class is deleted), and it is STRONGER than
the old pinned statement: commutativity comes for free from the transport,
so the full abelian-group-scheme refinement promised by the blueprint
(`thm:pic_is_group_scheme`) lands in one step. -/

/-! ## §6. Local finiteness of the Picard scheme

Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1): the Picard scheme is separated and locally of
finite type over the base. Since the run-0010 strengthening, `HasPicScheme`
packages local finiteness together with the representability existential
(one existence package, as in Kleiman's theorem), so the carrier below is
PROVED by extraction. It is what the identity-component substrate
(`Picard/IdentityComponent.lean`, `GroupScheme.IdentityComponent`) consumes
to specialise to `G = PicScheme C`. -/

/-- Typeclass asserting that the structural morphism of the Picard scheme is
locally of finite type (Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1): `Pic_{C/k}` is a
disjoint union of open quasi-projective `k`-subschemes, hence locally of
finite type). Run 0010: the instance below is PROVED — the strengthened
`HasPicScheme` existential carries local finiteness, so the property of the
`Classical.choose` witness is its second `choose_spec` component; the class
survives only to preserve the blueprint-pinned consumer signature. -/

/-- Existence instance for `PicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType` — **PROVED** (run

existence package as representability, so the strengthened `HasPicScheme`
existential carries it and the property of the chosen witness is the second
component of its `choose_spec`. The instance hypothesis is now
`[HasPicScheme C]` rather than `[HasRationalPoint C]`: the rational-point
conditionality lives entirely in `instHasPicScheme` (which supplies
`HasPicScheme C`), and any consumer able to name `PicScheme C` already
quantifies over `[HasPicScheme C]`. -/
