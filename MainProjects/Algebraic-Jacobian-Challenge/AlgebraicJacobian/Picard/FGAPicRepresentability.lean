# FGA representability of the Picard scheme (A.2.c)

This file is the **A.2.c** assembly chapter for the project's positive-genus
arm of `nonempty_jacobianWitness`. It states the FGA representability of the
relative Picard functor of a smooth proper geometrically integral curve
`C/k`, following Kleiman, "The Picard scheme", §2 and §4 (cf. FGA Explained
Ch. 9; arXiv:math/0504020).

## Status (run-0008 rewire — `picSharp` is now the REAL relative functor)

The former §0 placeholder (`picSharp` as a `Classical.choice` extraction from
a `⟨sorry⟩`-backed `Nonempty` typeclass, with **no defining property**) has
been replaced: `picSharp C` is now **defined** as the honest relative Picard
functor

```
picSharp C := PicSharp.relPresheaf C ⋙ forget AddCommGrpCat
```

on the `H_T`-coset carrier `T ↦ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)` of sibling
`Picard/RelPicFunctor.lean` (§4b there; blueprint
`def:rel_pic_sharp` after the coordinated repin). Consequently the
representability statements below have actual mathematical content: the
`RepresentableBy` witness extracted from `representable C` is a genuine
natural bijection `(T ⟶ Pic_{C/k}) ≃ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)`, which is
what the downstream tangent-space computation (`AJC.pic0av`,
`Pic0.tangentSpaceIso`) attaches to.

## The étale-sheafification route: Kleiman §2 Thm 2.5 (route (b))

Kleiman §4 represents the **étale-sheafified** functor `Pic_{(C/k)ét}`.
Mathlib at the pinned revision has no étale Grothendieck topology on
schemes, so instead of sheafifying we use Kleiman §2 **Thm 2.5**: when
`f : X → S` has a **section** and `O_S = f_* O_X` holds universally (true
for our proper geometrically integral `C/k`), the comparison maps

```
Pic_{X/S}(T) → Pic_{(X/S)ét}(T) → Pic_{(X/S)fppf}(T)
```

are all **bijective**. Hence, under a `k`-rational-point hypothesis
(`HasRationalPoint C` below), the *plain* relative functor `picSharp C` is
itself representable, and the FGA statement can be made against it directly
— no étale topology needed. Without a section the plain functor is NOT
representable in general (it need not even be a Zariski sheaf), which is why
the representability sorry `instHasPicScheme` below is **conditional on
`[HasRationalPoint C]`**: an unconditional instance would assert a false
statement. (Run-0008 memory `I-0061`: the same trap ruled out wiring
`picSharp` to the *absolute* functor `PicSharp.presheaf`.)

## Sorry accounting after the rewires (run 0008 `picSharp`, run 0010 fga-div)

The file has exactly **two** remaining sorry sites, both `⟨sorry⟩` instance
constructors of `Prop`-valued classes:

1. `instHasPicScheme` — the single genuine **FGA sorry**: existence of a
   representing scheme for `picSharp C`, **locally of finite type over `k`**,
   given a rational point (Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1) + Cor `cor:algsch`,
   transported through §2 Thm 2.5). Run 0010 strengthened the existential to
   also carry local finiteness — part (1) of the same Kleiman theorem, one
   existence package — absorbing the former separate
   `instPicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType` sorry.
2. `instHasAbelMap` — the `Nonempty` statement is true (the pointwise-zero
   natural transformation into the group-valued target witnesses it), but
   the extracted carrier stays opaque until the substantive Abel map
   `D ↦ [O_{C ×_k T}(D)]` lands.

Everything else is REAL or PROVED:

* `picSharp` — REAL (run 0008), the relative Picard functor.
* `divFunctor` — REAL (run 0010): the relative-divisor functor
  `Scheme.DivFunctor C.hom` of `Picard/DivFunctorDef.lean` (Kleiman §3
  Def. `df:div`, invertible-kernel quotient encoding); consequently
  `instHasDivFunctor` is **PROVED** (witness: `divFunctor C`).
* `instPicSharpRepresentable` — **PROVED** (`Exists.choose_spec.1`): the
  scheme chosen by `PicScheme` represents `picSharp C` by construction.
* `instPicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType` — **PROVED** (run 0010,
  `Exists.choose_spec.2`): local finiteness is the second component of the
  strengthened `HasPicScheme` existential.
* `groupSchemeStructure` — **PROVED** via `GrpObj.ofRepresentableBy`:
  Yoneda transport of the abelian-group structure of `relPresheaf`.
* `smoothProperQuotient` — the Altman–Kleiman quotient lemma is kept as a
  theorem extracting from an explicit **use-site hypothesis class**
  `HasSmoothProperQuotient`. The former GLOBAL `⟨sorry⟩` instance was
  **deleted in run 0008**: it asserted `P.IsRepresentable` for *every*
  presheaf morphism `α : Z ⟶ P`, which is flagrantly false. Even the
  theorem's hypothesis list is weaker than Kleiman §4 Lem `lm:qt` (it
  omits quasi-projectivity of the representing scheme `Y`, not currently
  expressible in Mathlib — no `QuasiProjective` vocabulary), and with the
  étale-local lift hypothesis a Hironaka-type free ℤ/2-action on a smooth
  proper 3-fold gives a smooth proper equivalence relation whose quotient
  sheaf is an algebraic space that is NOT a scheme. The class must
  therefore be supplied at the use site, where quasi-projectivity of the
  Abel-map slice is available.

/-! ## §0. The relative Picard functor and the divisor functor

`picSharp` is the honest relative Picard functor of sibling
`Picard/RelPicFunctor.lean` (Kleiman §2 Def `df:Pfs`), with the group
structure forgotten (representability is a statement about the underlying
set-valued functor; the group structure is transported back onto the
representing scheme by `groupSchemeStructure` below).

`divFunctor` (the relative-effective-divisor functor `Div_{C/k}`, Kleiman §3
Def `df:div`) is, since run 0010, the REAL functor `Scheme.DivFunctor C.hom`
of sibling `Picard/DivFunctorDef.lean` (A.2.b), replacing the former
`⟨sorry⟩`-backed opaque carrier. -/

/-- **The relative Picard functor** `Pic^♯_{C/k} : (Sch/k)^op ⥤ Type (u+1)`,
`T ↦ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)` — the set-valued shadow of the group-valued
presheaf `PicSharp.relPresheaf` of `Picard/RelPicFunctor.lean` (the honest
`H_T`-coset carrier of Kleiman §2 Def `df:Pfs`).

Run-0008 rewire: this replaces the former opaque
`Classical.choice`-of-`⟨sorry⟩` placeholder; it is now a REAL definition with
computational content, so `RepresentableBy` witnesses against it carry a
genuine natural bijection `(T ⟶ Pic_{C/k}) ≃ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)`.

Universe note: the values live in `Type (u+1)` because the line-bundle
carrier `LineBundle.OnProduct` is a quotient of (large) sheaves of modules.
`Functor.RepresentableBy` is universe-polymorphic, so representability by a
(`Type u`-homed) scheme remains a well-formed — and, under a rational point,
true — statement. -/

`Classical.choice`-of-`⟨sorry⟩` extraction. Natural transformations out of it
(the Abel map `abelMap` below) therefore have actual mathematical content.

/-! ## §1. The Picard scheme

The Picard scheme `Pic_{C/k}` of a smooth proper geometrically integral curve
`C/k` **with a `k`-rational point** is the `k`-scheme representing the
relative Picard functor `picSharp C` (which, under the rational point, agrees
with the étale-sheafified functor of Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main` by Kleiman §2
Thm 2.5). The scheme is separated, locally of finite type over `k`, and a
disjoint union of open quasi-projective `k`-subschemes; the
abelian-group-scheme structure is `groupSchemeStructure` below.

Blueprint reference: `def:pic_scheme` (Kleiman §4 Def. `df:Psch`). -/

/-- Typeclass asserting existence of a scheme over `Spec k` that represents
the relative Picard functor `picSharp C` **and is locally of finite type over

instance below, **conditional on `[HasRationalPoint C]`** — without a section
the plain relative functor is not representable in general, so an
unconditional instance would assert a false statement. Consumers that
quantify over `[HasPicScheme C]` as a hypothesis remain kernel-clean.

Run 0010 strengthening: the existential also carries
`LocallyOfFiniteType X.hom`. This is truth-preserving because Kleiman §4 Thm
`th:main`(1) makes local finiteness part of the SAME existence package as
representability (`Pic_{C/k}` is a disjoint union of open quasi-projective
`k`-subschemes), so the strengthened statement is exactly as true as the old
one; it lets the local-finiteness carrier `instPicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType`
be PROVED by extraction instead of carrying its own sorry. -/

geometrically integral curve is representable by a separated `k`-scheme
locally of finite type), combined with Kleiman §2 Thm 2.5 (under the
`k`-rational point of `[HasRationalPoint C]`, the plain relative functor
`picSharp C` coincides with the étale-sheafified one, so the same scheme
represents it).

Run 0010: this sorry now also carries Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1) — the
representing scheme is **locally of finite type** over `k` (a disjoint union
of open quasi-projective `k`-subschemes) — since the strengthened
`HasPicScheme` existential packages local finiteness together with
representability; the former separate `instPicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType`
sorry is absorbed into this one.

Isolated sorry site (project axiom-isolation pattern): the substantive

package — is not in Mathlib at the pinned revision. It is bundled directly
into the `HasPicScheme.has_pic_scheme` existential (alongside
representability and separatedness, matching Kleiman §4–§5) and extracted by
`Classical.choose_spec`; kept here as a single named instance so the

/-! ## §2. The Abel map — line-bundle / Quot correspondence

The bridge from line bundles on `C ×_k T` to the Quot scheme is the **Abel
map**: a relative effective divisor `D ⊆ C ×_k T` over `T` determines a
`T`-point of `Div_{C/k}`, and the dual ideal sheaf
`O_{C ×_k T}(D) := I_D⁻¹` represents a class in `Pic^♯_{C/k}(T)`.

/-- Typeclass asserting existence of the Abel map `Div_{C/k} ⟶ Pic^♯_{C/k}`.
The single `⟨sorry⟩` instance below is the unique sorry-carrying site for
`abelMap`. (The bare `Nonempty` statement is true — the pointwise-zero
natural transformation into the group-valued target witnesses it — but the
carrier stays opaque until the substantive Abel map arrives with the
Quot-scheme engine.) -/

The run-0008 rewire made the TARGET the real relative Picard functor, and the
run-0010 rewire made the SOURCE the real relative-divisor functor
(`divFunctor C = Scheme.DivFunctor C.hom`), so both endpoints now have
mathematical content; the natural transformation ITSELF is still extracted

/-! ## §3. The smooth-proper quotient lemma — Altman–Kleiman descent

The structural lemma underlying Step 4 of Kleiman §4 Thm. `th:main`: given a
surjection `α : Z ⟶ P` of étale sheaves with `R := Z ×_P Z` representable,
`Z` representable **by a quasi-projective scheme**, and the first projection
`R ⟶ Z` smooth and proper, the quotient `P` is representable.

**Run-0008 restructure (truth audit).** The former global instance
`instHasSmoothProperQuotient : ∀ α, HasSmoothProperQuotient α := ⟨sorry⟩`
asserted that EVERY presheaf receiving any natural transformation is
representable — flagrantly false — and was deleted. Moreover the theorem's
own hypothesis list is strictly weaker than Kleiman §4 Lem `lm:qt`: it lacks
**quasi-projectivity of `Y`** (not currently expressible — Mathlib has no
`QuasiProjective` vocabulary), and without it the statement is false: a
Hironaka-type free `ℤ/2`-action on a smooth proper non-projective 3-fold
gives a smooth proper equivalence relation satisfying hypotheses (1)–(4)
whose quotient étale sheaf is an algebraic space that is not a scheme.

`HasSmoothProperQuotient α` therefore survives only as an **explicit
use-site hypothesis**: the intended consumer (the FGA assembly, Step 4 of
`th:main`) instantiates it for the Abel-map slice `Z ⟶ P^{φ_0}_0`, where `Z`
is a quasi-projective open of `Div_{C/k}` and Altman–Kleiman descent
genuinely applies. Supplying that instance is part of the `instHasPicScheme`
obligation, not a standalone global fact.

Let `Z, P : (Sch/k)^op ⥤ Type (u+1)` be presheaves and `α : Z ⟶ P` a natural
transformation with: (1) `Z` representable by `Y`; (2) `R := Z ×_P Z`
representable by `R`; (3) the first projection `π : R ⟶ Y` smooth and proper;
(4) `α` an étale-local surjection (every `T`-point of `P` lifts along some
test morphism). Then, granting the use-site hypothesis
`[HasSmoothProperQuotient α]` (which additionally encodes Kleiman's
quasi-projectivity of `Y` — see the section header for why it cannot yet be
stated internally), `P` is representable.

The Lean body extracts the conclusion from the hypothesis class; the

Let `k` be a field and `C` a smooth proper geometrically integral curve over
`k` (with, through the `HasPicScheme` hypothesis chain, a `k`-rational
point). Then the relative Picard functor `Pic^♯_{C/k}` is representable by
the Picard scheme `PicScheme C`: there is a natural bijection

```
(T ⟶ Pic_{C/k}) ≃ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)
```

for every `k`-scheme `T`. After the run-0008 rewire this `RepresentableBy`
structure is a genuine comparison against the real relative Picard functor
(not an opaque placeholder), so downstream consumers (tangent-space
computation at the identity, `Pic⁰` degree theory) can compose with its
`homEquiv` to transfer line-bundle data to scheme points. -/

/-! ## §5. The abelian group-scheme structure

The Picard scheme `Pic_{C/k}` inherits an abelian group-scheme structure from
the tensor product of invertible sheaves on `C ×_k T`: the relative Picard
presheaf is group-valued (`PicSharp.relPresheaf`), and a representing object
of (the set-valued shadow of) a group-valued presheaf is canonically a group
object, by Yoneda transport (`GrpObj.ofRepresentableBy`).

Run-0008: with `picSharp` now REALLY equal to `relPresheaf ⋙ forget`, this
transport is a genuine proof, replacing the former `⟨sorry⟩`-backed
`PicSchemeGroupObject` carrier class (deleted).

§4 Def. `df:Psch`). -/

/-- The multiplicative (`CommGrpCat`-valued) avatar of the relative Picard
presheaf, used to feed `GrpObj.ofRepresentableBy` (whose API is
multiplicative). Carrier-level it is the same functor: `Multiplicative` is a
type synonym. -/

/-- **The Picard scheme is a commutative `k`-group scheme** — a canonical
`CommGrpObj` structure (i.e. `GrpObj` + `IsCommMonObj`) on `PicScheme C`,
obtained by Yoneda transport (`CommGrpObj.ofRepresentableBy`) of the
abelian-group structure of the relative Picard presheaf
`PicSharp.relPresheaf` along the representability witness `representable C`.
Concretely: `[L] + [M] = [L ⊗ M]`, `-[L] = [L⁻¹]`, unit `[O_{C ×_k T}]`,
transported through `(T ⟶ Pic_{C/k}) ≃ Pic(C ×_k T)/π_T^* Pic(T)`.

Run-0008: this is now a real construction (the former `⟨sorry⟩`-backed
`PicSchemeGroupObject` carrier class is deleted), and it is STRONGER than
the old pinned statement: commutativity comes for free from the transport,
so the full abelian-group-scheme refinement promised by the blueprint
(`thm:pic_is_group_scheme`) lands in one step. -/

/-! ## §6. Local finiteness of the Picard scheme

Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1): the Picard scheme is separated and locally of
finite type over the base. Since the run-0010 strengthening, `HasPicScheme`
packages local finiteness together with the representability existential
(one existence package, as in Kleiman's theorem), so the carrier below is
PROVED by extraction. It is what the identity-component substrate
(`Picard/IdentityComponent.lean`, `GroupScheme.IdentityComponent`) consumes
to specialise to `G = PicScheme C`. -/

/-- Typeclass asserting that the structural morphism of the Picard scheme is
locally of finite type (Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1): `Pic_{C/k}` is a
disjoint union of open quasi-projective `k`-subschemes, hence locally of
finite type). Run 0010: the instance below is PROVED — the strengthened
`HasPicScheme` existential carries local finiteness, so the property of the
`Classical.choose` witness is its second `choose_spec` component; the class
survives only to preserve the blueprint-pinned consumer signature. -/

/-- Existence instance for `PicSchemeLocallyOfFiniteType` — **PROVED** (run
0010): Kleiman §4 Thm `th:main`(1) makes local finiteness part of the same
existence package as representability, so the strengthened `HasPicScheme`
existential carries it and the property of the chosen witness is the second
component of its `choose_spec`. The instance hypothesis is now
`[HasPicScheme C]` rather than `[HasRationalPoint C]`: the rational-point
conditionality lives entirely in `instHasPicScheme` (which supplies
`HasPicScheme C`), and any consumer able to name `PicScheme C` already
quantifies over `[HasPicScheme C]`. -/
